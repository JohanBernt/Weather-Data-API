# Weather-Data-API
A little weather app using API to receive and present data. 
I used openweathermap.org and Postman.com to create an API key.
You are able to enter the city, hit go, and the app tells you the weather type (e.g. cloudy), the temperature in degrees celcius, and has an icon that represents the type of weather it is. 

There is a screenshot in the file which shows the result of a search.

This code should be run in atom and in a chrome browser using localhost:3000. You should have npm, nodemon and express.js installed to ensure the code runs correctly.
